The input shape files are stored in an external repository. On a machine with a kerberos token for CERN access (e.g. lxplus) the repository can be checked out as:

`git clone https://:@gitlab.cern.ch:8443/cms-vhbb/HIG16044.git shapes`

This doesn't require a password. Otherwise with normal https access (which does require a username and password) the repository can be checked out as:

`git clone https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-vhbb/HIG16044.git shapes`
